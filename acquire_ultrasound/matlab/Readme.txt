Control Picoscope digital oscilloscope and arbitrary waveform generator from Matlab

Code written for Picoscope 5000 series
2 oscilloscope channels implemented

Requirements
--------------
1) Matlab R2020a or later with toolboxes
	i)  Instrument Control  
	ii) Signal Processing 
2) Picoscope SDK. Installed from 'PicoSDK_64_10.7.20.192.exe' (64 bit Windows)
3) Matlab code in folder 'Matlab_app'

Operation
------------
The program is written as a Matlab app. It can be run from two m-files
1) AcquirePulses_Picoscope5000a.mlapp		The original Matlab app. This can be edited in the Matlab app editor
2) AcquirePulses_Picoscope5000a_exported.m	Matlab m-file exported from the Matlab app. This does not involde the app editor and may run faster, but should not be edited
